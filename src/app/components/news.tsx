    review:
      "Alok Sama spent several years at the elbow of Masayoshi Son, the Japanese founder of SoftBank who made a fortune from the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, lost a fortune in the office-rental business WeWork, and made another fortune with Sprint, T-Mobile and the British semiconductor company Arm. Mr. Son hoses money at startups around the world on a scale that gives even the hardiest venture investors nosebleeds.",

      "SEMAFOR:In ‘Money Trap,’ an ex-SoftBank executive revisits the madness",
    review:
      "On Wall Street, self-pity, like lunch, is for wimps.” That’s Alok Sama, describing in a memoir out this week his mindset as a Morgan Stanley investment banker approaching mid-career burnout in 2014, when a chance encounter changed his course: At a wedding in Italy, he spotted “an Asian gentleman, elegantly attired in a white lounge suit, standing slightly removed from the others” and with “the wizened appearance of Yoda.”",

      "Kirkus Reviews: A sometimes bumpy but always thrilling ride on the high-finance roller coaster…",
    review:
      "Finance whiz and hedge fund trader Sama recounts a far from ordinary stint in the C-suite. Sama opens with a scenario worthy of a Matt Damon hero: threatened with blackmail by an unnamed bad guy, he connects with two ex-Mossad agents in downtown London who deliver the news that “there is a conspiracy to remove you from your job” and demand a cool million bucks to make it go away. Go away it does not, and Sama’s narrative is peppered with ulcer-inducing moments trying to dodge the unknown threat. There’s big money at stake: Sama is a key advisor to Japanese investor Masayoshi Son, who has $100 billion at his disposal. Sama had had sightings of Son in earlier jobs: in the mid-1990s, Son, for instance, had thrown $100 million at Yahoo, which turned in $30 billion before the tech bubble burst. Feeling undervalued at Morgan Stanley—“I should have walked away, but I didn’t,” he writes. “Nobody does; nobody walks out of the money trap”—Sama gladly went to work for Son, only to discover that megazillionaires can be odd ducks with idées fixes that don’t always pay off in reality. In Son’s case, he was smitten by Adam Neumann’s WeWork, which, on paper at least, aligned with Son’s own mantra, “My goal is happiness for everyone. Nobody should be sad. I want technology to make people happy.” Son’s seed money certainly made many a tech startup happy, especially in the ride-share space, although many ventures failed to come through. With billions of dollars swirling around his narrative, Sama is a helpful interpreter of how such things as derivatives and Amazon's “consumer value proposition” work—or don’t. Throughout, he is an engagingly funny, self-aware, and often rueful narrator.",

      "Sroll.in: What did partying wildly at Ibiza have to do with Alok Sama joining Softbank?",
    review:
      "It began with a pill. Pacha is the mecca for Ibiza clubbers, and that night master blaster DJ David Guetta was the caliph. The setting for Pacha is unlikely, even tacky. The neighbourhood has the feel of a decrepit US suburban strip mall, complete with a sprawling parking lot across the street. The building itself is a cavernous warehouse. A Costco logo might seem in character, but what you get instead is an entrance flanked by faux palm trees, with a giant neon sign flashing Guetta’s message of universal love. f*** me, i’m famous. Once inside, more dazzling signage, T-shirts worn by a few, and pink psychedelic phallic objects wielded by many combine to drill the slogan into your brain. A message as loud as the techno beats, as ludicrous as it was ubiquitous. FMIF.",

    review:
      "The world is bubbling with talk of an AI bubble. But what is a bubble anyway? For me, it is the nadir of a hype cycle for an idea or an asset, when we suspend reality and individual brilliance merges into a collective insanity. Bubbles are never easy to spot. Charles MacKay, author of ‘Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds’ — the definitive guide to bubbles — himself failed to identify the bubble of his lifetime: railways. And the thing is, even if you know you are in a bubble, you cannot predict when it might burst.",
